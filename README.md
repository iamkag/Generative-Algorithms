## About

Generative algorithms can produce a wide range of visual outputs, from intricate patterns to organic designs, through automated processes. This project demonstrates various techniques and algorithms that leverage randomness, iteration, and mathematical principles to generate visual art.

## Features

- Multiple generative algorithms implemented in Python
- High-quality output for images and patterns
- Configurable parameters to control aspects like shape, color, complexity, and randomness
- Examples showcasing different artistic styles and structures

## Setup and Usage

To run the algorithms in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iamkag/Generative-Algorithms.git
   cd Generative-Algorithms
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Install the necessary libraries from `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run a script:**

   Each generative algorithm is located in its own script file. Run any script by executing:

   ```bash
   python <script_name>.py
   ```

4. **Configure Parameters:**

   Each algorithm has parameters that can be adjusted directly in the script file to customize aspects like pattern complexity, color schemes, shapes, and randomness.

## Examples

Here are some examples of the patterns and visuals generated by this project:

* [Pattern 1](./examples/pattern1.png)
* [Pattern 2](./examples/pattern2.png)

## Dependencies

This project uses the following libraries:

- `numpy`: For numerical operations and matrix manipulations
- `matplotlib`: For visualizing and plotting the generated patterns
- `PIL`: For advanced image processing
- Other dependencies can be found in `requirements.txt`
